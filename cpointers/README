Some "C" programme samples.
Especially complex pointer programmes.
I will add some more programmes.

USAGE of programmes is at head_lines of source file.
pointer_2d_array.c  :  Explains how a element in 2-D array can be accessed using array pointers.
pointer_function.c  :  Demo programme for  function pointers and function returning pointer.
simple_shell.c      :  Demo programme for double pointers. Just does fork+exec.
