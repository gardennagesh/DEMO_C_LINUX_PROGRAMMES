 This File README .

 This programme is just to demonstrate how dynamic-logger-level can be implemented  

 This programme is NOT multi-Thread-safe. logmsg function is not thread safe   

 Header and module file:     1)logmsg.h  2)main.c  3)logmsg.c    4)abc.c   5)xyz.c  

 USAGE: Compile files in a temp_dir cc -o dylogs main.c abc.c xyz.c logmsg.c 

 Run "./dylogs" executable.

 You can observe log_levels of abc.c and xyz.c changes based upon ODD or EVEN value of random-val.
